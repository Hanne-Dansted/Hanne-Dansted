          <h3>if in doubt DO NOT FEED</h3>
          <h3>when trying a new feed introduce it gradually over a few days mixed in with the original feed</h3>
          
          <h3>feeding</h3>
          <p>Feed a good quality pellet that is specifically designed for rabbits</p>
          <p>small amounts of fresh fruits and vegtables and a constant supply of hay are also diet staples</p>
          <p>treats should not exeed 10% of the total food intake</p>
          
          <h3>water</h3>
          <p>fresh clean water should always be availible and changed every day</p> 
          <p>it is best to use a water bottle or heavy bowl to avoid containation and spillage</p>
          

          <h3>hay</h3>
          <p>hay is a very mportant part of your rabbit's diet, as it provides a good source of roughage to maintain digestive health</p>
          <p>hay should make up at least 80% of your rabbit's daily food intake</p>
          <p>hay is also esssntial for bedding this should be freshend up daily</p>
          
          <h3>fruit and vegtables</h3>
          <p>(for a list of good vegtables see above)</p>
          <p>vegtables are a great source of nutriants and add variety to your rabbit's diet</p>
          <p>it is important that you vary the vegtables you give your rabbit, ideally feed a selection of 3 vegtables a day</p>
          <p>introduce any new vegtable one at a time with two already existing favourites</p>
          <p>do not feed lettuce as the high water content will often lead to diarrhoea</p>
          <p>fresh grass is also acceptable as long as it has not been sprayed with any chemicals (and never lawn clippings)</p>
          
          <h3>housing</h3>
          <p>you are best to provide you rabbit with the largest enclosure you can afford</p> 
          <p>and it must be at least 4 times the length of the adult rabbit</p>
          <p>the enclosure should be escape proof and have an area with a solid surface</p>
          <p>rabbits were not designed to spend all day on a wire grid</p>
          <p>position - keep your hutch in an area where there are no great extremes in temprature or draughts</p>
          <p>if you rabbit is to be housed outdoors, make sure there is shelter from th wind and direct sunlight</p> 
          <p>rabbits can tolerate cold weather if properly acclimatized and sheltered but they must be put under shelter in the winter</p>
          <p>rabbits can not tolerate high tempratures</p>
          <p>place 3-5cm of bedding in the bottom of your rabbits cage using hay (ceder based beddings are not reccomended</p>
          <p>your bunny will also need a nest box or hidey hole</p>
          
          <h3>litter training</h3>
          <p>rabbits can be taught to use a litter box </p>
          <p>by placing the rabbit droppings(pills) into the litter box over a period of a few days </p> 
          <p>they tend to use corners as toilets so place your litter box in the coner that your rabbit has chosen</p>
          <p>older rabbits can also be taught to use a litter box - infact they become better learners the older they get</p>
          <p>use a rabbit spesific litter</p>
          
          <h3>grooming</h3>
          <p>rabbits generally stay clean but can be bathed using a small animal shampoo</p>
          <p>some long coated rabbits need regular (sometimes daily) and thorough brushing and grooming</p>
          
          <h3>bathing</h3>
          <p>Make sure you have rabbit safe shampoo. Many human, dog, and cat shampoos contain chemicals that are toxic to rabbits</p>
          <p>Make sure you are going to use a cleaning product that it is rabbit safe If it does not state that it is, assume that it is not, just to be safe</p>
          <p>Make sure that you really need shampoo If you just have urine on the hindquarters (this is pretty common in male rabbits) 
          that can usually be rinsed away with water on the surface of the fur, without the need for thorough cleaning with shampoo</p>
          
          <p>Use warm, but not hot water. Rabbit fur generally protects your rabbit from the effects of water but when you are bathing them, the water will soak through to the skin If it is too hot or too cold, your rabbit could go into shock</p>
          <p>My rule of thumb is water that I could put my hand in with no immediate discomfort, and leave in without any discomfort  If it is too hot/cold for you, it is too hot/cold for your rabbit</p>
          
<p>Do not make your rabbit sit in a pool of water. It is not normal for rabbits to sit in water, and doing so causes them stress</p>

<p>Keep your rabbit properly supported. - A rabbit spine can break relatively easily. And even if it does not break, if your rabbit is not being supported properly, it can be painful and cause stress. Most of the time, your rabbit will want its back feet supported. When you need to clean that area, flip the rabbit over into Trance position. Make sure that the rabbit's back is properly supported, then clean the feet, and genital area</p>

<p>Bathe only the areas needed. The most common problem I see is that my rabbit will sometimes get some poop caked on their feet and/or underside. When this happens, I do my best only to wash the areas that need cleaning. This will reduce the time spent in the bath. Also when you bathe your rabbit, the process will wash away some of the natural oils that protects the rabbit and its fur. Limiting the areas you bathe reduces the impact of this</p>

<p>Try to avoid getting water in their nose. This is as uncomfortable to a rabbit as it is to you, and they do not have the ability to blow their nose like we do. For this reason, I try my best to avoid getting my rabbits' heads wet at all. When it happens, I immediately try to help the rabbit by drying their nose with cotton balls. Just hold it for a second or two on each nostril, repeating until it comes away dry</p>

<p>Dry your rabbit as thoroughly as possible. When the bath is done, if the rabbit is not dried well, they will get cold and this causes stress, and may even send them into shock. I dry my rabbit with towels. If the rabbit has angora fur, you may want use a blow dryer on low heat<p>
