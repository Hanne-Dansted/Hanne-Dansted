          <h3>if in doubt DO NOT FEED</h3>
          <h3>when trying a new feed introduce it gradually over a few days mixed in with the original feed</h3>
          
          <h3>feeding</h3>
          <p>Feed a good quality pellet that is specifically designed for rabbits</p>
          <p>small amounts of fresh fruits and vegtables and a constant supply of hay are also diet staples</p>
          <p>treats should not exeed 10% of the total food intake</p>
          
          <h3>water</h3>
          <p>fresh clean water should always be availible and changed every day</p> 
          <p>it is best to use a water bottle or heavy bowl to avoid containation and spillage</p>
          

          <h3>hay</h3>
          <p>hay is a very mportant part of your rabbit's diet, as it provides a good source of roughage to maintain digestive health</p>
          <p>hay should make up at least 80% of your rabbit's daily food intake</p>
          <p>hay is also esssntial for bedding this should be freshend up daily</p>
          
          <h3>fruit and vegtables</h3>
          <p>(for a list of good vegtables see above)</p>
          <p>vegtables are a great source of nutriants and add variety to your rabbit's diet</p>
          <p>it is important that you vary the vegtables you give your rabbit, ideally feed a selection of 3 vegtables a day</p>
          <p>introduce any new vegtable one at a time with two already existing favourites</p>
          <p>do not feed lettuceas the high water content will often lead to diarrhoea</p>
          <p>fresh grass is also acceptable as long as it has not been sprayed with any chemicals (and never lawn clippings)</p>
          
          <h3>housing</h3>
          <p>you are best to provide you rabbit with the largest enclosure you can afford</p> 
          <p>and it must be at least 4 times the length of the adult rabbit</p>
          <p>the enclosure
